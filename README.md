This lab is a small blog made with React. It has a page that shows a list of blog posts and pages for each post that change depending on the link you click. There is also a login page and a special admin page that only people who are logged in can see.
The hardest part for me was figuring out how to connect everything together. I had to learn how to use React Context to keep track of whether the user is logged in or not. I also had to make sure that only logged-in users can see the admin page. Working with the links and making pages that change based on the URL was tricky at first.
This lab helped me understand how to use React Router for moving between pages and how to use Context to share information in the app. It was a good way to learn important skills for building real React apps.
